JS EXECUTION CONTEXT-->
whenever u make a file, js executes and runs the file...js runs the file   in  2phases.

whenever we make a file and gives it to Js..then everytime happens a GLOBAL EC.
this GEC is kept inside a variable named THIS.
when we run GEC in browser  "this" value would be a window object.but it differes in node ,bun,dino.
JS is a single threaded lamguage

Whenever a code file is given to JS.there happens 2things.Thy are:
Global EC-->This would happen for sure.would be kept in this variable and this happens in a thread ,,
In browser, this value would be window object.
Function EC, 
Eval EC(in Mangoose)(it is a property of Global object)

//how Js code executes::::
Js runs the file in 2 phases...
1)Memory creation phase or creation phase -->allocates the space or memory to variables or whatever declared.
2)Executon phase

EXAMPLE:::::
let val1=10;
let val2=20;
function addBoth(val1,val2){
   let total = val1+val2;
   return total;
    }
let result1 = addBoth(val1, val2);
console.log(result1); //30
//console.log(result2); //Cannot access 'result2' before initialization
let result2 = addBoth(40,50)
console.log(result2); //90

Steps when js code file executes:::
1)Whenever a code file runs in Java GLOBAL EC gets created and would be allocated in "this variable.
2)Memory creation phase(MCP) or Creation Phase(CP) or Memory Phase(Mp) or cycle1
In this all the variable would be collected and stored  at one place.
Here all the variable are collected and "undefined is stored in them."
from above pgm, 
we take 
val1--->undefined
val2---->undefined
addBoth---->function definition from 23 to 26.
result1--->undefined
result2--->undefined

3)cycle 2 or execution phase
val1--->10
val2--->20
addBoth---->whenever a function runs it creates new execution CONTEXT.
NEW EC has new variable environment+execution thread.
that means 1)Memory phase
val1--->undefined
val2--->undefined
total--->undefined
2)Execution phase
val1--->10
val2-->20
total--->30 and this total would be stored in GEC.
Note:::Once the execution is done , this execution context is deleted.

result1----> 30
result2---->whenever a function runs it creates new execution CONTEXT.
NEW EC has new variable environment+execution thread.
that means 1)Memory phase
val1--->undefined
val2--->undefined
total--->undefined
2)Execution phase
val1--->40
val2-->50
total--->60 and this total would be stored in GEC.
Note:::Once the execution is done , this execution context is deleted.
result2---->60

cycle 2 execution phase is finished
